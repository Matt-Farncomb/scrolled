# Project 1

A book review site built wtih Python, Flask and SQL.

Only very basic design elements have been added so far, but functionality is mostly complete.

Users can review and rate books taken from my db. Additional Ratings are also taken from the  goodreads.com API.

My site also has it's own API where users can retrieve information such as avg ratings and author of partciular books via their ISBN.
